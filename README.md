# IBM Developer Model Asset Exchange: MAX Recommender

This repository contains code to instantiate and deploy a recommender model.
This model can be trained on a dataset containing users, items, ratings, and timestamps and make personalized item recommendations for a given user. Once trained, the input to the model is a user IDs and the output is a list of recommended item IDs sorted by probability in descending order. For demo purposes this model has been trained on a subset of the [MovieTweetings Dataset](https://github.com/sidooms/MovieTweetings), containing 457 users with their IDs mapped from 0 to 457 for convenience.

The model is based on the [Neural Collaborative Filtering model]([https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders]). The model files are hosted on
[IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://max-cdn.cdn.appdomain.cloud/max-recommender/1.0.0/assets.tar.gz).
The code in this repository deploys the model as a web service in a Docker container. This repository was developed
as part of the [IBM Developer Model Asset Exchange](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/models/) and the public API is powered by [IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/Bdz2XM).

## Pre-requisites:

* `docker`: The [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) command-line interface. Follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for your system.
* The minimum recommended resources for this model is 4GB Memory and 2 CPUs.

# Steps

1. [Deploy from Quay](#deploy-from-quay)
2. [Deploy on Kubernetes](#deploy-on-kubernetes)
3. [Deploy on Red Hat OpenShift](#deploy-on-red-hat-openshift)
4. [Run Locally](#run-locally)

## Deploy from Quay

To run the docker image, which automatically starts the model serving API, run:

```
$ docker run -it -p 5000:5000 quay.io/codait/max-recommender
```

This will pull a pre-built image from the Quay.io container registry  (or use an existing image if already cached locally) and run it.
If you'd rather checkout and build the model locally you can follow the [run locally](#run-locally) steps below.

## Deploy on Kubernetes

You can also deploy the model on Kubernetes using the latest docker image on Quay.

On your Kubernetes cluster, run the following commands:

```
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/IBM/MAX-Recommender/raw/master/max-recommender.yaml
```

The model will be available internally at port `5000`, but can also be accessed externally through the `NodePort`.

A more elaborate tutorial on how to deploy this MAX model to production on [IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/Bdz2XM) can be found [here](http://ibm.biz/max-to-ibm-cloud-tutorial).

## Deploy on Red Hat OpenShift:

  Follow the instructions for the OpenShift web console or the OpenShift Container Platform CLI in [this tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/deploy-a-model-asset-exchange-microservice-on-red-hat-openshift/) and specify `quay.io/codait/max-recommender` as the image name.

## Run Locally

1. [Build the Model](#1-build-the-model)
2. [Deploy the Model](#2-deploy-the-model)
3. [Use the Model](#3-use-the-model)
4. [Development](#4-development)
5. [Cleanup](#5-cleanup)


### 1. Build the Model

Clone this repository locally. In a terminal, run the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/MAX-Recommender.git
```

Change directory into the repository base folder:

```
$ cd MAX-Recommender
```

To build the docker image locally, run: 

```
$ docker build -t max-recommender .
```

All required model assets will be downloaded during the build process. _Note_ that currently this docker image is CPU only (we will add support for GPU images later).


### 2. Deploy the Model

To run the docker image, which automatically starts the model serving API, run:

```
$ docker run -it -p 5000:5000 max-recommender
```

### 3. Use the Model

The API server automatically generates an interactive Swagger documentation page. Go to `http://localhost:5000` to load it. From there you can explore the API and also create test requests.

User the `model/predict` endpoint to retrieve recommendations for a user ID. The number of predictions returned can be specified with `num_results`, by default the model returns 5 predictions.


![SWAGGER UI SCREENSHOT](docs/swagger-screenshot.png)

You can also test it on the command line, for example:

```
$ curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/model/predict?user_id=1&num_results=5" -H "accept: application/json"
```

You should see a JSON response like that below:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "predictions": [
      {
      "user": "1",
      "item": "1454468",
      "prediction": 0.995230495929718
    },
    {
      "user": "1",
      "item": "1300854",
      "prediction": 0.9938176274299622
    },
    {
      "user": "1",
      "item": "77413",
      "prediction": 0.9930911064147949
    },
    {
      "user": "1",
      "item": "1731141",
      "prediction": 0.9929673671722412
    },
    {
      "user": "1",
      "item": "363226",
      "prediction": 0.9914621710777283
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Development

To run the Flask API app in debug mode, edit `config.py` to set `DEBUG = True` under the application settings. You will then need to rebuild the docker image (see [step 1](#1-build-the-model)).

### 5. Cleanup

To stop the Docker container, type `CTRL` + `C` in your terminal.

## Train this Model on Watson Machine Learning

This model supports both fine-tuning with transfer learning and training from scratch on a custom dataset. Please follow the steps listed under the [training readme](training/README.md) to retrain the model on [Watson Machine Learning](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/machine-learning), a deep learning as a service offering of [IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/Bdz2XM).
